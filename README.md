# Do-You-Love-Me
A tiny, cute interactive static site for asking someone whether they love you.

How to run locally:

Open index.html in your browser (or use Live Server in VS Code).
What I changed:

Unified layout across pages with a modern, pastel theme
Added accessible UI, evasive "No" buttons (but clickable), and confetti + heart animations
Added favicon.svg and site.webmanifest
Next steps:

Tweak wording, colors, or animations per your taste
Add more content or a single-page version if desired
